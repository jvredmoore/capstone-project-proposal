# Capstone Project Proposal

This exercise is designed to help you narrow the scope of your research down to a well-defined problem whose solution you can reasonably derive over the course of the next five to six weeks. 


## Project Team
* Jared
* Shevaughn
* Aldo
  
## Research Area(s)
> _What technical topic(s) are you planning to explore through this project?_
* _React_


## Inspiration
> _Your problem statement is a concise (100 words or less) explanation of the problem that your project will address and the potential impact that the solution will have. In other words, what's "new" about this thing that you're creating and why should people care. For additional guidance, see [here](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/problem-statement/)._
 _In New York City pickup basketball provides exercise, a sense of community, recreation, and fun. The problem with the way people play pickup basketball now is that there is no way of knowing who is on the court to play. The only way to find out is to go to a basketball court in person, if no one is there to play you may have to travel to another park. We want to create an application that can make this process virtual so that people can spend their time playing basketball instead of traveling._ 

## Proposed Solution
> _In 100 words or less, describe what you plan on building and how it addresses your selected problem? In what ways is your solution novel?_
_Our app is for the basketball community, updated based on live updates provided by hoopers registered for the app. We plan to have a friends feature where you can add hoopers in your neighborhood and see their statusâ€“whether they are at a court or not. You will also be able to use our map without having an account, so that any user can use our app to be able to tell how many people are at a court. You will not be able to create post or provide updates unless you are a registered user._

## Anticipated Technical Challenges
> _What are the key technical challenges that your team will have to solve in order to ship this solution?_
* _Storing information on the user such as Location_
* _Implementing a friends feature_

## Supporting Research
> _Please include hyperlinks to blogs, research papers, and books that have helped inform your opinion so far or those that you believe will guide your research?_
